**NOTE:** This project is no longer actively maintained, but the source code is still available, completely unsupported, for anyone who might be interested.

SimpleAS3 offers a fresh approach to Flash scripting that helps regular users create interactive experiences with less code than standard AS3. Typical daily tasks are easier when the compiler is not as strict, and you can do your job without constantly searching for the meaning of a million obscure errors.

One of the best parts is that SimpleAS3 code works right in the Adobe Flash authoring tool. Your regular daily workflow won't change much at all. You can still create your SWF by pressing Ctrl-Enter, and you can still put your code on the timeline.
