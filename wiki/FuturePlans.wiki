==Planned Features==

The following features, extras, and supporting materials are either planned or being considered for future versions of SimpleAS3

  * The Flash authoring tool extension needs the ability to inject SimpleAS3 into any existing FLA file. Currently, the SimpleAS3 extension always creates a new FLA file.
  * More extensive examples should be created. They should demonstrate complete "real world" projects.
  * More quick-load functions like loadXML() or loadChild(). For example, JSON is a common API result format.

==Questions to You==

Please feel free to leave a comment below. Answer any or all of the following questions.

   * SimpleAS3 does many things the AS2 way. Is there anything else wish could be simplified?
   * Is the documentation easy to understand? What could be improved? Could the organization of each page be better in any way?
   * Could a SimpleAS3 project be easier to create?
   * If SimpleAS3 were to include a set of downloadable examples, what sort of projects do you think would make good examples? (Examples: banner ads, blog widgets, ...what else?)
